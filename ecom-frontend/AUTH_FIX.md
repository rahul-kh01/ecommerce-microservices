# 🔐 Authentication Fix Applied

## ✅ Issue Resolved!

### Problem
The frontend couldn't extract the JWT token from the backend response.

**Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "jwtToken": "eyJhbGc...",  ← Token is here
  "username": "admin",
  "roles": ["ROLE_ADMIN", ...]
}
```

**Frontend Was Looking For:**
```javascript
const token = data.token || data.jwt || data.accessToken;  ❌ Wrong fields!
```

### Solution
Updated frontend to check for `jwtToken` first:
```javascript
const token = data.jwtToken || data.token || data.jwt || data.accessToken;  ✅ Correct!
```

## 🔄 Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Development Mode (Hot Reload)
If your dev server is running (`bun run dev`), it should auto-reload!
Just refresh your browser.

### Option 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
cd ecom-frontend

# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C if running)

# Start again
bun run dev
```

### Option 3: Docker Production Build
```bash
cd ecom-frontend
bun run build
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate frontend
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Clear browser cache/local storage** if you still see issues
2. **Check browser console** for any error messages (F12)
3. **Use correct port**: 5173 for dev, 3000 for Docker
4. **Test with known credentials** first (admin/adminPass)
